Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Autonomous Vision Group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/). As part of the [ELLIS Ph.D. program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), I am co-supervised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/) (University of Tübingen) and [Prof. Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.siyutang.html) (ETH Zürich). My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision (3D vision), machine learning (deep learning), and computer graphics (geometry, rendering).
